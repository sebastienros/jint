# Jint.HtmlParser

Jint.HtmlParser is an experimental native markup package for .NET 8 and .NET 10. Its implemented public surface includes:

- A mutable document tree with elements, attributes, text, comments, CDATA and processing instructions.
- Inert HTML document and contextual fragment parsing through `MarkupParser.ParseHtml` and `ParseHtmlFragment`, with lexical limits and bounded diagnostics.
- XML document and fragment parsing through `MarkupParser.ParseXml` and `ParseXmlFragment`, and strict SVG-root parsing through `ParseSvg`.
- CSS Syntax parsing of whole stylesheets, rules, declarations and component values. These methods return syntax, without CSS property validation or computed styles.
- Native mutation subscriptions with explicit record draining through `Document.ObserveMutations`.
- Explicit HTML/XML serialization through `MarkupSerializer`, with output limits, cancellation and selected native shadow roots.
- XPath 1.0 compilation, evaluation and selection through `NativeXPath`, preserving namespaces and native result identities.

```csharp
using Jint.HtmlParser;

var document = MarkupParser.ParseXml("<root><item/></root>");
var root = document.DocumentElement!;
var fragment = MarkupParser.ParseXmlFragment("<next/>", root);
root.AppendChild(fragment);
```

HTML parsing recovers malformed markup and creates implied document structure. Fragment results belong to the context owner document and leave existing children untouched. `HtmlParseOptions.ScriptingEnabled` changes grammar without executing scripts. Native HTML parsing performs no network requests.

Whole-sheet CSS parsing returns immutable syntax and the exact original source:

```csharp
using Jint.HtmlParser;
using Jint.HtmlParser.Css;

CssStyleSheetSyntax sheet = MarkupParser.ParseCss("@future x; p { color: var(--theme); }");
foreach (CssRuleSyntax rule in sheet.Rules)
{
    string originalRule = sheet.Source.Substring(rule.Span.Start, rule.Span.Length);
    Console.WriteLine(originalRule);
}
```

`ParseCss` consumes the whole input with standard CSS Syntax recovery; empty input succeeds.
Rules expose immutable preludes and nested token, function and block components with original UTF-16 spans.
Unknown at-rules, unsupported properties, invalid property values and pending substitutions remain syntax.
Parsing does not validate selectors or properties, resolve URLs, load imports, attach styles, or compute a cascade or geometry.
`CssParseOptions` supplies the existing limits and optional diagnostic collector; cancellation is supported.
The result retains no parser, options or collector. Public mutable CSSOM promotion and equivalent CSSOM benchmarks are separate work.

Serialization selects its format explicitly, without moving nodes or fetching resources:

```csharp
string html = MarkupSerializer.ToHtml(document);
string xml = MarkupSerializer.ToXml(document, requireWellFormed: true,
    limits: new SerializationLimits { MaxOutputCharacters = 100_000 });
```

`ToHtmlChildren` and `ToXmlChildren` omit the container's tags and use template contents where appropriate.
`requireWellFormed` enables the DOM Parsing algorithm's checks; it is not general XML/DTD validation.
Output-limit failures throw `SerializationLimitException` without returning partial output.
Normal HTML output omits attached shadow roots. `Element.AttachShadow` returns the real native
`ShadowRoot` (even for closed mode); `OpenShadowRoot` exposes only open roots. Pass roots explicitly
in `HtmlSerializationOptions`, or pass `serializableShadowRoots: true` to include reachable roots marked
serializable. Attachment does not execute Browser custom-element reactions or resolve its definitions.

XPath expressions can be reused across documents:

```csharp
NativeXPathExpression expression = NativeXPath.Compile("//item");
IReadOnlyList<object> nodes = NativeXPath.Select(document, expression);
double count = NativeXPath.Evaluate(document, "count(//item)").NumberValue;
```

Unprefixed XPath element tests match no namespace; use a namespace resolver for HTML/XML namespaces.
Contexts can be a `Node`, an attached/detached non-XMLNS `Attr`, or a captured `XPathNamespaceBinding`.
Results contain only native nodes, attributes and namespace bindings. Membership and captured scalar
values remain stable after mutation; the selected native objects themselves are not frozen.
Reusing a namespace context rejects a binding whose URI is no longer in scope. No BCL cursor or
mutable expression escapes. Cancellation brackets BCL work but is not a hard timeout during its
non-preemptible compilation/evaluation intervals.

`Jint.Browser` now uses this native tree, parser and CSS model. Neither production packages nor tests
depend on AngleSharp. AngleSharp, AngleSharp.Css and AngleSharp.Xml remain only in `Jint.Benchmark`
as comparison controls; dependency removal is not a claim of complete behavioral parity.

## Remaining replacement work

The main gaps are above HTML tokenization and tree construction:

| Area | Current boundary |
| --- | --- |
| CSS property grammars | `CssPropertyRegistry` implements a subset of `CssPropertyCatalog`. Content alignment, gap and legacy grid-gap aliases now have grammar, declarations and computed-value support. Borders/background shorthands, grid tracks, font-family/line-height, animation/transition and SVG paint remain pending. A catalog entry is an obligation, not implemented support. |
| CSS rules and nesting | Native media, supports, container, imports, font-face and keyframes exist. Layers, namespaces, scope, page/counter-style and property registration remain incomplete, as do import `layer()`/`supports()` conditions, nested conditional rules and interleaved declarations. |
| Computed and resolved values | Advanced colors, typed `attr()` and other substitution functions, some container metrics and used-value dependencies remain named completion failures. Browser also still documents incomplete stylesheet BOM/charset and MIME handling. |
| Standalone APIs | HTML/XML serialization and owned XPath APIs are public. Selectors, mutable CSSOM/typed values and incremental HTML sessions remain internal. Public parsing accepts decoded strings, not streams or byte inputs. |
| Acceptance | XML external-resource/no-fetch review and canonical-output evidence remain outstanding. Browser fixture behavior, current WPT results and public API snapshots must be reconciled independently of package removal. |

Unknown syntax and known-but-unimplemented semantics are deliberately different: raw CSS syntax can
be retained lazily, but demanding an incomplete grammar raises a named failure rather than inventing a
computed value. Passing tests for that failure boundary does not establish support for the feature.
HTML/XML comparisons have untimed structural checks; equivalent CSSOM comparison and paired
performance acceptance remain separate work.

The dependency-ordered [completion tracker](../docs/design/html-parser-completeness.md) separates
implemented slices from still-open CSS families, public API gates and acceptance debt.
