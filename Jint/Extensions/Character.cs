        // negative inputs). Note that even if this subtraction underflows, this happens before
        // the result is zero-extended to ulong, meaning that `i` will always have upper 32 bits
        // equal to 0. We then left shift the constant with this offset, and apply a bitmask that
        // has the highest bit set (the sign bit) if and only if `c` is in the ['0', '0' + 64) range.
        // Then we only need to check whether this final result is less than 0: this will only be
        // the case if both `i` was in fact the index of a set bit in the magic constant, and also
        // `c` was in the allowed range (this ensures that false positive bit shifts are ignored).
