# Jint.HtmlParser implementation record

## Scope and workflow

The requested package replaces AngleSharp in Jint.Browser with a new API for HTML,
SVG, XML, CSS, DOM mutation tracking, and browser integration. Performance must be
demonstrated against AngleSharp on equivalent work. The user explicitly supersedes
the earlier repository direction to retain AngleSharp.

- Integration worktree: `/Users/sebastienros/.codex/worktrees/bd4c/jint`.
- Integration branch: `codex/html-parser-integration`.
- Starting revision: `d78d25137526b4a7b35ccdcfc8522730acd392d1`.
- Design, planning, and reviews: GPT-6 Astra, high reasoning.
- Feature implementations: dedicated GPT-6 Sol, high reasoning tasks in local worktrees.
- Merge finalized feature commits into the integration worktree; no pull requests.

## Initial repository evidence

At the starting revision, Jint.Browser targets `net8.0;net10.0` and references
AngleSharp 1.8.2, AngleSharp.Css 1.1.2, AngleSharp.Xml 1.2.0, and
AngleSharp.XPath 2.0.6. There are 194 browser C# files containing AngleSharp
references. This includes generated bindings, DOM storage, mutation observation,
CSSOM, parsing, and script/resource scheduling.

`Runtime/DocumentFetch.cs` reads a bounded response body, decodes it, and supplies
the resulting string to `Runtime/Parsing/ParserDriver.cs`. Script suspension and
`document.write` insertion are separate requirements from transport streaming.

## Validation

- Baseline Release build: in progress.
- No parser implementation or performance claim has been completed yet.
